Data Description
The Titanic dataset is a widely used dataset for machine learning and data analysis, containing information about the passengers of the RMS Titanic, which sank on its maiden voyage in 1912. The dataset includes various attributes for each passenger, such as:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.

Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

Pclass: Ticket class (1 = First, 2 = Second, 3 = Third).

Name: Name of the passenger.

Sex: Gender of the passenger.

Age: Age of the passenger.

SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic.

Parch: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic.

Ticket: Ticket number.

Fare: Passenger fare.

Cabin: Cabin number.

Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

This dataset is commonly used for binary classification tasks, such as predicting survival, and for exploring patterns and relationships within the data, such as the impact of socio-economic status, gender, and age on survival rates.
